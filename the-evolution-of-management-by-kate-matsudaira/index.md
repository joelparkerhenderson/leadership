# The Evolution of Management by Kate Matsudaira

https://queue.acm.org/detail.cfm?id=3350548 (excerpts)

These are the biggest transitions that occur when moving from individual contributor (IC) to entry-level manager:

* Let go of the immediate/quick sense of gratification that comes from doing/building/creating.

* Accolades and recognition become less frequent as you move up.

* You derive your sense of accomplishment from mentoring, growing, and furthering the work of your team and those around you.

* Add value by removing roadblocks, streamlining processes, and helping others be productive.

* Think one to two years out for your project and roadmap.

* Help people connect their work to the parent organization or company, and help them see their individual impact and value.

Look two years into the future:

* How do all of your teams fit together?

* How should resources be distributed?

* What is critical to the organization's most important goals?

* What lessons do you need your people to learn?

* Where can you allow them to take control and make mistakes?

* What areas cannot fail and therefore need your oversight?

* What metrics do you need to measure and pay attention to? Why?

* How do you set up structures for visibility into progress?

Prepare for succession:

* What will you do if your best [fill-in-the-blank] leaves?

* What can you do to help make your best people want to stay with your team?

* Which resources do you need today, and what will you need a year from now?

* Who is on your team right now who could move up in the future?

* Which jobs don't exist today that you will need filled in the future?

* Have any team members outgrown their roles, or have any of the roles changed enough that they are no longer filled by the right people?

To establish a culture and values, ask yourself:

* What does it mean to be in your team?

* What do you stand for?

* How should decisions be made?

* How should issues be escalated?

* What are the principles you use to make tough calls?
