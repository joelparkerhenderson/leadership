# How to give a senior leader feedback (without getting fired)

Excerpts from [source](https://newsletter.weskao.com/p/how-to-give-a-senior-leader-feedback-without-getting-fired)

## “Even more” technique

The framing of “even more” works well because you’re speaking from a place of generosity and giving the benefit of the doubt.

You’re assuming they’re doing X—and that they should do it even more. You are assuming they are great--and you want to make them even stronger. 

🚫 “We need to give guidance to new hires.”

✅ “We need to give even more guidance to new hires.”

Why this works:

* The “before” scenario is binary—the senior leader either did or didn’t give guidance. And if they didn’t, well, they messed up. They feel threatened that you noticed.

* The “after” is a spectrum: You are generous in assuming that they did give guidance. You’re suggesting they may want to amp this up even more. This is much easier for them to accept.


## Use yourself as an example

Talk about yourself so it doesn’t seem like you’re pointing fingers. I do this whenever I want to say something the person might find insulting.

* 🚫 “You should try X.”

* ✅ “I used to struggle with this, and when I tried X, it really helped.” 

Saying “you should try X” is fine--there’s nothing inherently wrong about it. The reason I would avoid it is because of the power dynamic and CONTENT of what I’m saying. 

If there’s a power dynamic and/or the content of what I’m saying might be sensitive for the person, that’s when I share about my own experience. 


## Adopt diplomatic, curiosity-forward language

These phrases help you ease into the suggestion in a way that feels non-threatening:

* "We might want to try…”

* “I wonder if...”

* “Perhaps we could...”

* “What are your thoughts on...”

* “One approach might be...”

You adopt the vibe of a helpful team member who has your leader’s best interest in mind and wants to serve your organization. 


## Bring data and examples to support your point

Supporting your claims makes you more persuasive and objective--and increases the chances your senior leader will take your recommendation.

Example 1: Guidance during projects 

* 🚫 “We need to give more feedback during projects.”

* ✅ “I noticed when we reviewed the design mockups weekly with the client, they loved the final result. For this project, early check-ins could help us make sure we’re aligned before going too far down a certain direction and could prevent rework.”

Example 2: Setting priorities 

* 🚫 “The team needs clearer priorities.”

* ✅ “The team made amazing progress when we all focused on the website update last month. It might help to have one or two clear priorities for the team this month that everyone can rally behind.”

Example 3: Training new hires 

* 🚫 “We should spend more time training new people.”

* ✅ “When we were able to dedicate that first week to training Steve, he got up to speed pretty quickly. The bit of upfront time seemed to have paid off, and taking a similar training approach for our next hire could help them ramp up just as fast. What do you think?”

Why this works:

* Ends with a clear, actionable suggestion

* Shows the upside of updating their approach

* Keeps it simple, logical, and positive

Personally, I think phrasing a recommendation as a statement reduces cognitive load. You can follow up with an open-ended question, like “what do you think?”

Notice how the examples above are concrete AND concise. Avoid long diatribes and over-explaining—use your judgment to share just enough context.

Do not have a “well actually…” vibe when you share logic and data. This is obnoxious and will probably backfire.
