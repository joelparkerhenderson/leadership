# "Good engineering management" is a fad

Excerpts and edits from https://lethain.com/good-eng-mgmt-is-a-fad/

In the 2000s, I had two 1:1s with my manager over the course of two years. The first one came a few months after I started, and he mostly asked me about a colleague’s work quality. The second came when I gave notice that I was leaving. His management style closely resembled that of the team leader in The Soul of A New Machine: identifying an important opportunity for the team, and navigating the broader organization that might impede progress towards that goal. He was, in the context we were working in, an effective manager.

In the 2010s, mangers emphasized attracting, retaining, and motivating engineers. This made sense in the era of hypergrowth, where budgets were uncapped and many companies viewed hiring strong engineers as their constraint on growth. This was an era where managers were explicitly told to stop writing software as the first step of their transition into management.

In our current era that started in late 2022, higher interest rates killed zero-interest-rate-policy (ZIRP) and productized large language models are positioned as killing deep Engineering organizations. We’ve flattened Engineering organizations where many roles that previously focused on coordination are now expected to be hands-on keyboard, working deep in the details.

In each of these transitions, the business environment shifted, leading to a new formulation of ideal leadership. That makes a lot of sense: of course we want leaders to fit the necessary patterns of today. Where things get weird is that in each case a morality tale was subsequently superimposed on top of the transition:

In the 2010s, the morality tale was that it was all about empowering engineers as a fundamental good. Sure, I can get excited for that, but I don’t really believe that narrative: it happened because hiring was competitive.

In the 2020s, the morality tale is that bureaucratic middle management have made organizations stale and inefficient. The lack of experts has crippled organizational efficiency. Once again, I can get behind that–there’s truth here–but the much larger drivers aren’t about morality, it’s about ZIRP-ending and optimism about productivity gains from AI tooling.

The conclusion here is clear: the industry will want different things from you as it evolves, and it will tell you that each of those shifts is because of some complex moral change, but it’s pretty much always about business realities changing.

## Self-development across leadership fads

If you accept the argument that the specifically desired leadership skills of today are the result of fads that frequently shift, then it leads to an important followup question: what are the right skills to develop in to be effective today and to be impactful across fads?

Having been and worked with engineering managers for some time, I think there are eight foundational engineering management skills, which I want to personally group into two clusters: core skills that are essential to operate in all roles (including entry-level management roles), and growth skills whose presence–or absence–determines how far you can go in your career.

## The core skills

Execution:

- Lead team to deliver expected tangible and intangible work. Fundamentally, management is about getting things done, and you’ll neither get an opportunity to begin managing, nor stay long as a manager, if your teams don’t execute.

- Examples: ship projects, manage on-call rotation, sprint planning, manage incidents

Team:

- Shape the team and the environment such that they succeed. This is not working for the team, nor is it working for your leadership, it is finding the balance between the two that works for both.

- Examples: hiring, coaching, performance management, advocate with your management

Ownership:

- Navigate reality to make consistent progress, even when reality is difficult Finding a way to get things done, rather than finding a way that it not getting done is someone else’s fault.

- Examples: doing hard things, showing up when it’s uncomfortable, being accountable despite systemic issues

Alignment:

- Build shared understanding across leadership, stakeholders, your team, and the problem space. Finding a realistic plan that meets the moment, without surprising or being surprised by those around you.

- Examples: document and share top problems, and updates during crises

## The growth skills

Taste:

- Exercise discerning judgment about what “good” looks like—technically, in business terms, and in process/strategy. Taste is a broadchurch, and my experience is that broad taste is an somewhat universal criteria for truly senior roles. In some ways, taste is a prerequisite to Amazon’s Are Right, A Lot.

- Examples: refine proposed product concept, avoid high-risk rewrite, find usability issues in team’s work

Clarity:

- Your team, stakeholders, and leadership know what you’re doing and why, and agree that it makes sense. In particular, they understand how you are overcoming your biggest problems. So clarity is not, “Struggling with scalability issues” but instead “Sharding the user logins database in a new cluster to reduce load.”

- Examples: identify levers to progress, create plan to exit a crisis, show progress on implementing that plan

Navigating ambiguity:

- Work from complex problem to opinionated, viable approach. If you’re given an extremely messy, open-ended problem, can you still find a way to make progress? (I’ve written previously about this topic.)

- Examples: launching a new business line, improving developer experience, going from 1 to N cloud regions

Working across timescales:

- Ensure your areas of responsibility make progress across both the short and long term. There are many ways to appear successful by cutting corners today, that end in disaster tomorrow. Success requires understanding, and being accountable for, how different timescales interact.

- Examples: have an explicit destination, ensure short-term work steers towards it, be long-term rigid and short-term flexible

## Self-assessing on these skills

### Execution

When did your team last have friction delivering work? Is that a recurring issue?

What’s something hard you shipped that went really, really well?

When were you last pulled onto solving a time-sensitive, executive-visible project?

### Team

Who was the last strong performer you hired?

Have you retained your strongest performers?

What strong performers want to join your team?

Which peers consider your team highly effective?

When did an executive describe your team as exceptional?

### Ownership

When did you or your team overcome the odds to deliver something important? (Would your stakeholders agree?)

What’s the last difficult problem you solved that stayed solved (rather than reoccurring)?

When did you last solve the problem first before addressing cross-team gaps?

### Alignment

When was the last time you were surprised by a stakeholder? What could you do to prevent that reoccuring?

How does a new stakeholder understand your prioritization tradeoffs (incl rationale)?

When did you last disappoint a stakeholder without damaging your relationship?

What stakeholders would join your company because they trust you?

### Taste

What’s a recent decision that is meaningfully better because you were present?

If your product counterpart left, what decisions would you struggle to make?

Where’s a subtle clarification that significantly changed a design or launch?

How have you inflected team’s outcomes by seeing around corners?

### Clarity

What’s a difficult trade-off you recently helped your team make?

How could you enable them to make that same trade-off without your direct participation?

What’s a recent decision you made that was undone? How?

### Navigating ambiguity

What problem have you worked on that was stuck before assisted, and unstuck afterwards?

How did you unstick it?

Do senior leaders bring ambiguous problems to you? Why?

### Working across timescales

What’s a recent trade off you made between short and long-term priorities?

How do you inform these tradeoffs across timescales?

What long-term goals are you protecting at significant short-term cost?
